# 🌟 About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m Darlington John
-  A Frontend developer 
-  💻 I live in code — it’s how I stay grounded, focused, and expressive
-  🎧 Music keeps me grounded. I mean, I love music. But let’s be real — who doesn’t? 😒
-  🎌 Oh — I love anime too? Yeah, I’m that person. Sub > Dub. Fight me 🔥
-  ✨ When I’m not coding, I’m exploring new frameworks or dreaming up the next fun UI interaction.
