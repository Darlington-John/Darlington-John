_About Me_
👋 Hi, I’m Olaniyi Abeleje
👀 I’m interested in system design, product development, and software engineering.
When I’m not doing any of those, I like to listen to music and discuss bootstrapping and scaling ideas.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building solutions to real-life problems. I’m currently building in a couple of spaces: AI, productivity, collaboration, and HR tech.
